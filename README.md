# Path of Exile: Stash Application

I have made this application as part of the interview process.

## Functionality:
1. View a stash for player
2. Filter the stash by a textstring
3. Filter the stash by a "Legion"

## Reference data
An interface draft https://www.figma.com/file/EiO9Bkay0VUMSUwkkuoSLK/Path-to-Exile%3A-Stash?node-id=2587%3A5982


## My work log:
1. Get an assignment, read the description
2. Launch db-server and research data structure
3. Make an interface draft at the Figma
4. Create a new Angular project
5. Create a repository for a new project
