# Path of Exile: Stash Application

I have made this application as part of the interview process.

## Functionality:
1. View a stash for player
2. Filter the stash by a textstring
3. Filter the stash by a "Legion"

## Reference data
An interface draft https://www.figma.com/file/EiO9Bkay0VUMSUwkkuoSLK/Path-to-Exile%3A-Stash?node-id=2587%3A5982


## My work log:
1. Get an assignment, read the description
2. Launch db-server and research data structure
3. Make an interface draft at the Figma
4. Create a new Angular project
5. Create a repository for a new project

# Angular mock messages
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
