# Path of Exile: Stash Application

I have made this application as part of the interview process.

## Functionality:
1. View a stash for player
2. Filter the stash by a textstring
3. Filter the stash by a "Legion"

# Run
Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Database
Project work with local json-database. In dev mode, database server starts automatically.
In build mode, you need specify correct api url at `src/environments/environment.ts`.

## Reference data
An interface draft https://www.figma.com/file/EiO9Bkay0VUMSUwkkuoSLK/Path-to-Exile%3A-Stash?node-id=2587%3A5982
You can find local database dump in `db.json`

## My work log:
1. Get an assignment, read the description
2. Launch db-server and research data structure
3. Make an interface draft at the Figma
4. Create a new Angular project
5. Create a repository for a new project
6. Implement base functionality, that required by description
7. Add some design
